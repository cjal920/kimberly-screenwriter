    Available Faith-based spec scripts:

    1.	 Grace Like Rain.
    
    Logline: A college-aged christian waiting for marriage has a crisis of faith after she is sexually assaulted by her ex-boyfriend. While she fights for justice, he commits suicide, and she must learn to forgive through the grief to find her faith again.
    
    This is heavily inspired by true events that I've gone through in my life and my personal journey of faith. Although it deals with serious topics, it's written as close to PG as possible and has an optimistic tone about how all things can work together for good. 
    
    
    2.	Before Paul
    
    Logline:  After his betrothed converts to Christianity, Saul, a Pharisee and devout Jew, travels door to door to persecute heretical followers of the Messiah until he encounters a vision of Jesus and questions everything he believes. 
    
    
    Setting:  “BEFORE PAUL” is a faith-based, character-driven drama set in the biblical time surrounding the death of Jesus (33 A.D.), which focuses on the Apostle Paul, when he was SAUL, violently persecuting Christians, before he became the strong Christian figure we know today.  
    
    Synopsis:  
    
    “BEFORE PAUL” is a cross between “Risen” and “The Young Messiah.”  It is the story of the Saul, who, after a rough upbringing, has landed a coveted position at the Jewish Temple in Jerusalem. The heretic, JESUS, has just been arrested and sentenced to death by PONTIUS PILATE, at the urging of the unruly crowd. Jerusalem is full of out of town guests for Passover, including Saul’s family.
    
    After a riot kills his father, HANAN, Saul blames the tragedy on the Christians and vows to hunt them all down in payback.  The pressure from the Jewish leadership compounds this problem and he is elected to take this charge on behalf of all Jews.
    
    To make matters worse, when Saul learns that his own betrothed, CHLOE, has joined the Christians behind his back and breaks off their engagement, he is more determined than ever to silence every last one of them.  Saul attempts to win Chloe’s affection by offering her protection, but she refuses and encourages him to open his heart to the truth.
    
    Meanwhile, Pilate himself loses his wife and baby from childbirth and is haunted by his choice to crucify Jesus.  Fighting the truth, he refuses to believe that there is a God of the universe and continues to worship his statues.
    
    Slowly seeing the change in Chloe, along with several miracles that cannot be explained, Saul questions if Jesus could possibly be the Messiah. Desperate to save face with the Jewish leadership and not appear weak, Saul continues to hunt Christians, even with his conflicted spirit. When Chloe is dragged before the High Priest as a traitor and labeled Christian, Saul has no choice but to agree to her death or be labeled a hypocrite himself.
    
    But then, when Jesus appears to Saul on the road to Damascus, where he intended to hunt more followers of Christ, Saul cannot deny that it is all true.  As a result, Saul becomes a follower of Jesus himself.  Barely clinging to his newfound faith, he must choose either to believe in this Jesus and try to finally marry Chloe or fight against these feelings and risk losing her forever. However, there is a price on his head due to the change in him and he must sneak out of Damascus and return to Jerusalem at once.
    
    Before it’s all over, Saul will burn bridges due to his shift in faith, costing him his family, his position, wealth, and the comforts he once enjoyed.  In the end,, he is able to make amends with some, be cut off from others, boldly speak the name of Jesus, and forever change the course of history.  His dramatic change influences others to see the truth behind it all.  His journey as a true Apostle of Jesus, now known as Paul, can finally begin.
    
    The Apostle Paul is thought to have written thirteen books of the Bible, over half of the New Testament.  He is arguably one of the most important figures in the history of Christianity.
